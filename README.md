# React Todo App (State-Based)

- Todo application built with React
- Fully *CRUD* featured (Create, Read, Update, Destroy)

## Get Started

1. Star this directory & fork it
2. Git clone the repo url locally
3. `cd [project-path]`
4. `npm install`
5. `npm start`
6. click "Add A New Todo"
7. From here you can edit and delete

## Notes

- Understanding full CRUD in react is essential, however, most tutorials do not cover *edit* functionality
- This app uses a *conditionally rendered form* for _Create & Update_
- This application pairs with a YouTube React intro 5 part series (link coming soon)
- Since this is a state based application, your todo items *do not persist*
- When you refresh your browser, your data will be lost
- This application was built with *basic composition* in mind, meaning the crud functions are reusable across multiple component or state data types

# Happy Learning!
